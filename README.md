A Simple Sudoku Game

To run my game: 
1) download all the files in this repository
2) run in the directory with all the files: python GUI_sudoku.py

Incorrect entries show up in red and correct entries are in black. You can selected from 3 different difficulties: easy, medium, and hard.
You move around the board by clicking or using your arrow keys. The active cell is highlighted in red. No penalties for incorrect entries.
Clicking new game resets the board with the previous difficulty set. The default difficult is: easy.

Created for fun and to get reaquainted with coding in Python. Backtracking algorithm employed.
